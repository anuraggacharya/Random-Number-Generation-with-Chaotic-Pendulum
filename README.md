# Random Number Generation with Chaotic Pendulum

A double pendulum is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end, and is a simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions.The motion of a double pendulum is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations and is chaotic.
This behaviour can be used to generate random numbers.Altough the set of numbers generated will be higly sensitive to initial position of the pendulum body.
